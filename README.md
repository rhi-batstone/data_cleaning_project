# Data Cleaning Project

Cleaning up a very messy data set about halloween candy across 3 years. 
This was a project during my data analysis training to practice data cleaning to answer some specific questions about the dataset

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

`$ git clone https://github.com/rhi-batstone/data_cleaning_project`

## Running the tests

The cleaning has already been run, and saved as a cleaned .csv but in `cleaning_scripts/cleaning_script.R` you will find the code for this. 

The `documentation/documentation.html` details the process of cleaning and analysing this data.
