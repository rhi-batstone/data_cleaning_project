# Cleaning

### Libraries & Reading in the data
* Call the libraries for cleaning: *janitor*, *tidyverse* & *readxl*
* Read in the xlsx and specfiying the sheet.  
  + Separately called and cleaned each sheet.  
  
  
### Cleaning the data

* Separate cleaning for each sheet  
  
* Pivot longer to combine all the candy names  
  
* I then did another pivot longer to join all the ***weird***  questions together but this resulted in **7.5m** objects and kept making <span style="color: red;">**R angry**</span>.
![R Angry](session_aborted.png)  

* Did not clean the candy names because I have a recurring issue that I just can't make it work.  
* Separated date and time to make it more readable  
* **Used janitor to clean names**  
* Renamed the unecessarily long column names  
* And finally selected only for the columns of interest in the analysis questions to remove all the messy unecessary columns  

### Combining and Writing CSV  
* Decided to bind rows because there weren't any Primary of Foreign Keys that I could see (*not before trying to join unsuccessfully of course*)  
* Write clean data as CSV ready for analysis ()


# Analysis

### Libraries & data 
• Call the libraries for cleaning: *tidyverse* & *here*
```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

• Read in the data 
```{r, include=FALSE}
candy_data <- read_csv(here("clean_data/candy_clean.csv"))
```

### Q1  
*What is the total number of candy ratings given across the three years. (number of candy ratings, not number of raters. Don’t count missing values)*
```{r}
candy_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(response)) %>%
  summarise(num_candy_ratings = n())
```

### Q2  
*What was the average age of people who are going out trick or treating and the average age of people not going trick or treating?*  
• This theoretically works fine, but because I couldn't clean up the age column effectively the average person going out is infinity old. 
```{r}
candy_data %>% 
  drop_na(age) %>% 
  group_by(going_out) %>% 
  summarise(mean_age = mean(age))
```

### Q3  
*For each of joy, despair and meh, which candy bar revived the most of these ratings?*  
• Again, I couldn't clean up the candy bar names properly so they aren't tidy but it works! Although, I couldn't get it all to work as one line of code. 
```{r}
candy_data %>% 
  group_by(candy) %>% 
  filter(response == "JOY") %>% 
  summarise(top_joy = n()) %>% 
  top_n(1)

candy_data %>% 
  group_by(candy) %>% 
  filter(response == "DESPAIR") %>% 
  summarise(top_despair = n()) %>% 
  top_n(1)

candy_data %>% 
  group_by(candy) %>% 
  filter(response == "MEH") %>% 
  summarise(top_meh = n()) %>% 
  top_n(1)

# candy_data %>% 
#   group_by(response) %>% 
#   summarise(top = n()) %>% 
#   top_n(1, candy)
```

### Q4  
*How many people rated Starburst as despair?*  
• This one worked ok, but because I didn't clean the candy names I had to input both ways it was written
```{r}
candy_data %>% 
  filter((candy == "[Starburst]" | candy == "Q6 | Starburst") & response == "DESPAIR") %>% 
  summarise(number_of_people_who_hate_starburst = n())
```
