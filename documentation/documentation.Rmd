This document details the cleaning process for answering some basic analysis questions


# Cleaning

### Libraries & Reading in the data
* Call the libraries for cleaning: *janitor*, *tidyverse* & *readxl*
* Read in the xlsx and specfiying the sheet
  
  
### Cleaning the data

* Separate cleaning for each sheet  
  
* Pivot longer to combine all the candy names  
  
* I then did another pivot longer to join all the ***weird***  questions together but this resulted in **7.5m** objects and kept making <span style="color: red;">**R angry**</span>.

* Separated date and time to make it more readable  
* **Used janitor to clean names**  
* Renamed the unecessarily long column names  
* Ages and candy names cleaning took some work 
* And finally selected only for the columns of interest in the analysis questions to remove all the messy unecessary columns  

### Combining and Writing CSV  
* Bound rows together for the three years
* Write clean data as CSV ready for analysis


# Analysis

### Libraries & data 
• Call the libraries for cleaning: *tidyverse* & *here*
```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

• Read in the data 
```{r, include=FALSE}
candy_data <- read_csv("../clean_data/candy_clean.csv")
```

### Q1  
*Total candy ratings?*
```{r}
candy_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(rating)) %>%
  summarise(num_candy_ratings = n())
```

### Q2  
*Average age of trick or treaters and non trick or treaters*
```{r}
candy_data %>% 
  drop_na(age) %>% 
  group_by(going_out) %>% 
  summarise(mean_age = mean(age))
```

### Q3  
*Which candy had highest of each rating?*  
```{r}
candy_data %>% 
  group_by(candy) %>% 
  filter(rating == "joy") %>% 
  summarise(top_joy = n()) %>% 
  top_n(1)

candy_data %>% 
  group_by(candy) %>% 
  filter(rating == "despair") %>% 
  summarise(top_despair = n()) %>% 
  top_n(1)

candy_data %>% 
  group_by(candy) %>% 
  filter(rating == "meh") %>% 
  summarise(top_meh = n()) %>% 
  top_n(1)

```

### Q4  
*Total despair ratings for Starbursts??* 
```{r}
candy_data %>% 
  filter(candy == "Starburst" & rating == "despair") %>% 
  summarise(number_of_people_who_hate_starburst = n())
```
